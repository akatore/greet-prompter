Python is not an operating system; it's a high-level programming language. It doesn't manage the file system directly. Instead, it provides libraries and functions that allow you to interact with the file system in a way that's consistent across different operating systems.

In your Dockerfile, the `FROM python:3-alpine` line is specifying the base image for your Docker container. This image includes both the Python 3 interpreter and the Alpine Linux operating system. Alpine Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution that's often used for Docker containers because of its small size.

The `WORKDIR /app` line is using a Docker command to set the working directory inside the container. This is equivalent to running `cd /app` in a Linux terminal.

The `COPY . .` line is copying files from your current directory on your host machine into the current directory inside the Docker container, which is `/app` because of the previous `WORKDIR` command.

The `EXPOSE 80` line is telling Docker that your container will be listening on port 80. This doesn't actually publish the port; it's more like documentation. You still need to use the `-p` option with `docker run` to publish the port.

The `CMD ["python", "prompter.py"]` line is specifying the default command to run when the container starts. This is equivalent to running `python prompter.py` in a Linux terminal.

So, to answer your question, it's the Docker and the underlying operating system (in this case, Alpine Linux) that are managing the file system. Python is just the language your application is written in, and it interacts with the file system through the operating system's APIs.
