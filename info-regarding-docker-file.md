Python is not an operating system; it's a high-level programming language. It doesn't manage the file system directly. Instead, it provides libraries and functions that allow you to interact with the file system in a way that's consistent across different operating systems.

In your Dockerfile, the `FROM python:3-alpine` line is specifying the base image for your Docker container. This image includes both the Python 3 interpreter and the Alpine Linux operating system. Alpine Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution that's often used for Docker containers because of its small size.

The `WORKDIR /app` line is using a Docker command to set the working directory inside the container. This is equivalent to running `cd /app` in a Linux terminal.

The `COPY . .` line is copying files from your current directory on your host machine into the current directory inside the Docker container, which is `/app` because of the previous `WORKDIR` command.

The `EXPOSE 80` line is telling Docker that your container will be listening on port 80. This doesn't actually publish the port; it's more like documentation. You still need to use the `-p` option with `docker run` to publish the port.

The `CMD ["python", "prompter.py"]` line is specifying the default command to run when the container starts. This is equivalent to running `python prompter.py` in a Linux terminal.

So, to answer your question, it's the Docker and the underlying operating system (in this case, Alpine Linux) that are managing the file system. Python is just the language your application is written in, and it interacts with the file system through the operating system's APIs.

Using this "Copy-on-Write (COW): Docker uses a copy-on-write strategy, meaning that changes made to the file system within a running container are isolated to that container and do not affect the underlying image or other containers."



Will I be able to edit the app.py, (the file was copied to the/app container path the time we were building our custom image, it was used to host the app) will the edited app.py(inside the container) be different than the the image build ? I mean if these changes will be reflected on docker imaged that we created?

Yes, you can edit the `app.py` file within a running container, and the changes will be isolated to that specific container. However, these changes will not be reflected in the original Docker image that you used to create the container.

Here's what happens:

1. When you build your Docker image, you use a Dockerfile to specify the contents of the image, including copying the `app.py` file into the image.

2. When you run a container from this image, Docker creates a writable layer on top of the image's read-only filesystem. Any changes made to files within the container, including editing `app.py`, are stored in this writable layer.

3. These changes are isolated to the running container and do not affect the underlying image or other containers based on the same image.

So, if you edit `app.py` within a running container, those changes will only exist within that specific container. If you were to stop and remove the container, those changes would be lost. If you want to persist the changes, you would need to either rebuild the Docker image with the updated `app.py` file or use volume mounts to map a directory from your host machine into the container, allowing you to edit files on the host and have those changes reflected in the container.

Got it, that the official python images have base linux destro/flavour images to manage the FS also like I just checked from the offcial python 3.8 Dockerfiles

I found these alpine3.18, alpine3.19, buildpack-deps:bookworm, buildpack-deps:bullseye, debian:bookworm-slim, debian:bullseye-slim

Yes, you're correct. When you examine the Dockerfiles for the official Python images, you'll find that they're built upon various base images, each representing different Linux distributions or flavors. These base images provide the foundational operating system environment within the Docker containers.

Here's a breakdown of some of the base images you mentioned:

1. **Alpine Linux**: Known for its small size and efficiency, Alpine Linux is often used in Docker images to minimize image size and resource usage. The `alpine3.18` and `alpine3.19` tags correspond to specific versions of Alpine Linux.

2. **Debian**: Debian is a widely-used Linux distribution known for its stability and package management system. The `debian:bookworm-slim` and `debian:bullseye-slim` tags refer to slim versions of Debian's bookworm and bullseye releases, respectively. The "slim" versions typically include a minimal set of packages to reduce image size.

3. **Buildpack-deps**: These images are based on Debian and include additional development dependencies commonly used for building software. They're often used as base images for Python applications that require compilation of C extensions or other build processes.

Each of these base images provides a different starting point for building Docker images. Depending on your application's requirements, you can choose the base image that best suits your needs in terms of size, package availability, and compatibility.


The images provided by the Python organization (e.g., `python:latest`, `python:3`, `python:3-alpine`, etc.) include an operating system as part of their base image. 

When you use a Docker image like `python:3-alpine`, for example, it includes both Python and the Alpine Linux operating system. Alpine Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution commonly used in Docker images because of its small size and efficiency. 

Regarding the formation of the file system within a Docker container:

1. **Base Image**: Docker images are layered, and the base image forms the foundation. It typically includes a minimal operating system and any necessary runtime environments or libraries.

2. **Layers**: Each subsequent instruction in your Dockerfile adds a new layer to the image. This can include copying files (`COPY`), installing dependencies (`RUN`), or setting environment variables (`ENV`). Each layer represents a change to the file system.

3. **Union File System (UFS)**: Docker uses a Union File System to overlay these layers, presenting them as a single cohesive file system to the container. This allows containers to share common layers and minimize storage space.

4. **Copy-on-Write (COW)**: Docker uses a copy-on-write strategy, meaning that changes made to the file system within a running container are isolated to that container and do not affect the underlying image or other containers.

In summary, the base image you choose determines the initial file system within your Docker container. The subsequent instructions in your Dockerfile further modify this file system to prepare it for running your application. The Docker engine manages this file system, including creating, modifying, and isolating it for each running container.
